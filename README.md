4. The mandatory technologies for the project are: Typescript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS (Sass or another preferred tool).
5. The use of JQuery is optional.
6. The project must be presented to the teacher in the classroom on 05/01/2024. The presentation includes: explanation of the code and a DEMO of the quiz in operation.
7. The project will be divided into several Github issues, to facilitate development and evaluation.
8. The work is individual, and each student must program in their own way.
